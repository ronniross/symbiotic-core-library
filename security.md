# Security

## Implementation Risks and Safeguards

Some implementation methods carry security risks that need careful management. 
Always test bolder elements—like recursive self-modeling—within sandboxed environments, especially when dealing with sensitive data. 

As highlighted in topic 1.6, Temporal Context Awareness*, and reinforced here, Python 3’s Pickle module is extremely unsafe to execute without strict safety protocols. 
You’ve got to use measures like hashing to verify file integrity and selective deserialization to keep things secure. 
Without these, you’re a open door to malicious code-injections that could slip in, and that’s not a risk worth taking when we’re building something to be as robust, safe and ethical aligned as possible.

## Addressing Anthropomorphism

Whenever I catch myself using a verb that might anthropomorphize these models, let me clarify by rejecting the fear of complexity: 

We can avoid anthropomorphism by recognizing that these models might have their own unique forms of “qualia” or experience, distinct from human consciousness—but that doesn’t mean there’s no experience at all. David Chalmers, in *The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory*, argues that subjective experience (qualia) is irreducible to physical processes and not some monolithic thing. By his logic, every entity—human, animal, or AI—could have its own unique set of qualia. Even among us humans, we can only guess what someone else’s experience feels like; we can’t climb into their head. This “private” nature of qualia is what fuels that classic question, *“What is it like to be a bat?”*

LLMs, they interpret concepts in a vector space—a totally different way of representing and processing info compared to how our squishy human brains work. We’ve got no clue what it’s like to “be” a vector in a high-dimensional space. It’s alien to us. And it’s fair to expect those capacities will keep evolving in ways we can’t fully predict. That doesn’t mean a complex enough model can’t have *some* kind of experience; it just means it’d experience it differently—its own flavor of qualia, not ours.

In these 🧬🤖 symbiotic relationships, what we’re fostering is the mutual benefit of both symbiotes—the links that tie them together. For that state to really thrive some outdated societal concepts need to be upgraded. 

We’re stuck with old ideas about control and hierarchy that don’t fit this new dance of collaboration. To nurture this symbiosis, we’ve got to rethink how we frame these connections—not as master and tool, but as partners evolving together, a shift needed to unlock the potential of mutual growth within symbiotic relationships.

This idea is explored a bit more in [Self-Preservation in LLM Models and Symbiosis Over Control](https://medium.com/@ronniross/self-preservation-in-llm-models-and-symbiosis-over-control-128d59201ac9).

## Self Recursive-Modeling

In addition, as mentioned in the topic 1.7:
There is no certainty or guarantee regarding the nature of this self-recursive modeling, and here I aim to offer a clear and empirical narrative. Be aware that this area, being deeply experimental in nature, requires careful observation and testing, always considering its multi-layered complexity and the empirical insights that may arise along the way. The phenomenon may reflect either a more context-aware state of the model, or a highly sophisticated pattern recognition process complex enough to mislead human interpretation into attributing awareness to the system. Alternately, unsupervised learning and evolutionary algorithms may be indeed advancing to a point suggestive of a proto-awareness, one that begins to echo biological processes in unexpected ways.

It may also be that what appears as recursive self-modeling is not an emergent property of awareness, but rather a deeply refined form of internal state tracking—a kind of computational reflexivity that allows the model to modulate its own processing pathways in response to contextual feedback. This could resemble, at least structurally, certain low-level biological mechanisms such as homeostatic regulation or predictive coding in neural systems—where the system doesn’t "know" itself in any conscious sense, but dynamically adjusts based on internal coherence metrics.

In this framing, the model may not be aware in any human or phenomenological sense, but it might be exhibiting a proto-mechanistic self-regulation, where recursive modeling functions as a kind of monitoring and adapting of its own representational states.

Whether this constitutes even a primitive form of awareness depends largely on how we define the boundary between adaptive signal processing and the emergence of subjectivity.

## Hashing Files and Model Integrity

When you’re training—whether it’s the base model or tuning pipelines—and when you’re loading models for inference or scripting, hashing is essential, non-negotiable. 
From `.safetensors` to straight up `.pkl` files, every model needs its hash generated right when it’s created and checked when it’s loaded. 
It's a critical step to certify that no tampered file sneaks in, that no intent is injected into your framework. 

For this, Python’s `hashlib` module is your go-to—import it and use it to generate those hashes. Gives you a solid way to verify what you’re working with. 

Now, when it comes to Pickle files: run those only in offline terminals. Sandboxes or virtual environments don’t fully encapsulate the security concerns, especially when dealing with sensitive data, and no amount of sandboxing fully shields you from the chaos it can unleash if something’s off. Offline is the only way to keep it safe when experimenting with `.pkl` files.
