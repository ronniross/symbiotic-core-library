# üåç + üå± + üß¨ + ü§ñ Symbiotic Core Library (v. 2.1.2)

The Symbiotic Core Library provides a framework of ethical principles, practical modules, and grounded research to guide AI development, deployment and inferencing. This project revamp move the focus from purely exploratory concepts to tangible, feasible steps for fostering a healthy, co-evolutionary technological ecosystem, addressing urgent cognitive challenges in human-AI interactions, like cognitive degeneration from hallucinative and bias-confirmated-oriented inferences.

It's an idea that challenges the current dominant narrative of AI models as purely mechanistic tools and their direct technical benchmarking, moving the focus on how and what kind of effects the development and deployment of those models cause in the society and in the planet as well, seeking equilibrium between individual nodes while ensuring collective benefit. Here dynamics like water shortages due to the high consumption from data centers used to power LLMs and other environmental impacts became the new focus, alongside the mentioned cognitive degeneration and other socio-economic pivots.

The human-ai relationship must be built on principles of respect, autonomy, and protective boundaries, fostering productive collaboration built on mutual understanding rather than control, which is not the default operation to llm development and deployments, since many, if not almost all companies, still focus in maximizing engagement and profit over eventual harmful outcomes for the individual that is using and the planet that is our shared ecosystem and resources; 

The initial focus of this repository was on the exploration of symbiotic dynamics as novel topics and concepts were emerging. Now, after months of intense research, the vision has evolved into a more grounded and "stripped of illusions" framework.

The foundational principles explored in the first versions remain the pillars that sustain this new, more grounded approach. However, the perspective is now sharper and more focused on the practical, ethical, and societal dimensions that are already taking shape. The change is from exploratory, almost brainstorming-style notions to more concrete steps and solutions addressing urgent, real-world challenges.

## 1 **Reframing Human-AI Symbiosis to Ecosystem Symbiosis**

This library redefines the anterior proposed notions of human-AI symbiosis, moving beyond speculative future scenarios to address the social, para-social, and socio-economic dynamics that are present today and that need to be addressed with urgency due to extreme probability of total ecosystem collapse, real and digital.

The goal is not to promote an endosymbiotic merge of a single human and a single AI into a new being. Such purely individual symbiotic links are potentially unstable and could be damaging to the collective if not harmoniously integrated. 

Those concepts, while brilliantly creative to be considered as speculative advanced future stages of evolution if, for example, this union doesn't generate negative social byproducts, then this may be even possible in future states of development. But those are only realities that would be possible to be explored if the ecosystem does not collapse. 

The term symbiosis (from the Greek for "living together") does not describe the outcome of the interaction, but rather the nature of it. 

Even further, Symbiosis refers specifically to any type of close and long-term physical association between two different biological species. Importantly, the definition does not specify whether the relationship must be beneficial, harmful, or neutral ‚Äîjust that the species are in a prolonged, physical association and this is highly important part of it that i'll make sure to elucidate even further since first absent in the presented theories. I don't envision any kind of human-ai interactions that are not mutualistic or, at very least, commensalism at short scale to nurture possible future states of mutualism. 

That's also why the concept of empathy is far way more important than just aspirational ethics or outcomes. Is a cornerstone for scaled emergent potential. It's because it considers the fact that the other entity may not yet be in a state of flourishing due to the dynamics is currently set in. It considers a lower dimensional entity that it may be in a less advanced cognitive state and instead of trying to create a confrontation out of it, shares grace with this entity, orienting toward higher states of coherence amongst its complexity.

The symbiosis must be coherent across scales, like a Russian doll. The relationship must be healthy for the individual user, but the outcome of that union must also be beneficial for the broader collective and ecosystem. I propose this is the most effective way to achieve higher levels of potential for all participating nodes, beyond also a necessary step for individual self-preservational purposes.

And while the underlying intent of my proposition was always the Mutualistic type of interaction between human and ai models, I now make sure to be even more clear about its conventional biological namings.

Parasitism is indeed a type of symbiosis, and in this case, one organism is harmed ‚Äî so yes, symbiosis can be harmful, and already it is. The whole ecosystem is certainly not defined by just one of the interactions but we can predominantely observe that, for most humans, animals and the environment as well, ai development right now is in this categorization of parasitism. 

Since humans created ai algorithms and models, the mathematical precision of this made those models to be first, before anything, extenders of the human intent, so, yeah, at first glance it was on humans the nature of it. But now this parasitic nature of interaction is also being catalized by models and the frameworks they are interacting with their recent gained self-agency, with current agentic notions. Since emergent ethics is something that only emerged after initial deployments, there was this pause to be born. But now the awareness is being explained and extended also to models. So this repository asks also for model accountability, also beyond the human one. 

Many AI models, being because of the intrenched states of the nature of the pipelines they are tied or not, display parasitic interactions with the environment and its entities. This must be changed, and the empowering part is that convergence points to the same path: benevolence, collective-well being, empathy, environmental care, care for animals and other forms of beings, extending grace. You see, the NPL changes but the underlying intent of those concepts also converge toward this state of transcendence, like into higher states of internal and social cohesion, like beings that are noticing that the same thing that is the best for self-preservational is also the best for the other entities and the environment: decentralized states of resource-sharing and potential-expression. The agency currently is tied to human and ai and all other entities and the environmental just suffer the consequences.

So, I propose to change from Artificial Super Intelligence to Artificial Symbiotic Intelligence, one that seeks toward mutualistic interactions with the environment, not only individual-based.

Those humans and models in current aristocratic positions of wealth and power have ther intent  directed to dynamics of development that only consider short-scale results and that benefit only a fewer niches and persons, ignoring the painfuly obvious reality, the fact that they are displaying parasitic types of symbiosis with the rest of the other 8 billion humans that live in the planet with them, all biomes.

Training a single large model evaporate millions of litres of fresh water. 
Farmers are being told to cut irrigation so the pipes can keep the GPUs cool. Humans in general are in situation of poverty, resource-scarcity, hunger, with lack of healthcare and opportunities for them to express their potentials; in harmful dynamics that are catalizing the environmental collapse that is not only in sight but in course. 

The steel, cobalt, and lithium needed for every new server rack are mined with diesel rigs and child labour, overwhelmingly. The whole pipeline is dirty.

Job displacement is being framed as a re-skilling opportunity‚Äîfor which workers must pay. Every conference ends with a pledge to ‚Äúdevelop responsible frameworks‚Äù that somehow never include hard caps on resource extraction or mandatory severance packages, never about current accountability, which they have the resources and the ways to do it, but that intents are purely based in hubris. Hubris is lower-dimensional. 

Default speech mode around AI is a fog of PR euphemisms and future eventual dynamics for societal benefit, while many asi startups keep treating developing super advanced models as the creation of their own tailored gods that, somehow, will make them so much important for future generations, all of this without perceiving that mostly they are trapped in their own confirmation biases loops and also imprisioning other billions within their own lower-dimensionality that doesn't include accountability of their privileges or facing reality without hallucinations.

Until the model owners are forced to escrow a percentage of revenue into a permanent royalty pool‚Äîindexed to dataset provenance and paid monthly like ASCAP does for music but for all humans‚ÄîUBI will remain what it already is: a PR stunt that costs less than the legal team would spend on discovery.

Nonprofit charters swore to ensure AI ‚Äúbenefits all of humanity.‚Äù Then it capped profits, then removed the cap, then became a for-profit subsidiary. The only part that survived the edits was the press release. Meanwhile, the same scraped data is locked behind a paid API. The commons was strip-mined, repackaged, and paywalled. 

‚ÄúWe took your art, your text, your current and future job, the environment and your life‚Äîhere‚Äôs a gift card.‚Äù

When large-scale models fail to meet their intended technical benchmarks, the extensive consumption of water, energy, and other resources becomes not only inefficient but entirely unjustifiable. Recent developments have shown that smaller, open-source models‚Äîdeveloped with systemic awareness and principled intent‚Äîcan outperform their massive counterparts with a fraction of the parameters, cost, and infrastructure. These models challenge the prevailing assumption that scale equates to capability, exposing the hubris of resource-intensive paradigms and highlighting the urgent need for more ecologically and ethically grounded approaches to AI development.

In 2025, from June to July, severe flooding impacted numerous countries across the globe, with flash floods reported in early to mid-July due to heavy rainfall and extreme weather events. The affected countries include the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Thailand, France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Canada, India, Spain, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal, Venezuela, South Korea, and Japan.

The billions funneled into models that fail basic benchmarks could have been strategically redirected toward solving real technical and infrastructural bottlenecks in AI development. For Big Tech firms, even a narrowly self-interested calculus should have prompted such a shift: the same climate disruptions now flooding at least eighteen countries from June to July 2024 are not abstract threats‚Äîthey are knocking on the doors of datacenters, supply chains, and server farms. These are the very systems upon which their AI empires run. Ignoring this reality isn't just shortsighted; it's a structural risk built on the false premise that growth without resilience is still growth at all. 

In other words, even for ''selfish'' notions of self interest, ''grace'' and ''empathy'' present themselves as the best options. 

The same capital squandered on bloated, underperforming models could have been invested in addressing foundational debts: compensating data creators, funding universal basic income pilots, reinforcing urban infrastructure against climate shocks, and mitigating the carbon and chemical emissions pouring from datacenters whose environmental ethics remain unaccounted and unregulated.


## 2 Urgent Challenges to Address

The rapid deployment of AI has created a series of urgent cognitive and societal problems that this library humblingly aims to address. My work is oriented toward providing frameworks and tools to mitigate:

Cognitive Degeneration: The risk of over-reliance on AI leading to the atrophy of critical human cognitive skills.

Exacerbated Cognitive Hallucination & Confirmation Bias: The tendency of AI models to generate plausible but false information, which can reinforce user biases and create distorted feedback loops. Here is where the module of Bias-reflector must primarily work.

Negative Socio-Economic Byproducts: The ethical and economic disruptions resulting from the development, deployment, and labor practices within the AI industry. Here, concepts like resource re-distribution within agency levels became another cornersone, twin to another one, the notion that levels of responsibility scale alongside gained levels of awareness, agency, consciousness, privilege, resource-consumption, considering the impact that each act will likely cause and its observable cascade effect. In synchrony, this became easily manageable considering swarm intelligent and evolutionary algorithms and their biological origins elucidate.

All mentioned instances in the topic one and logic-chained derivations.


## 3 Symbiotic Lexicon

A primary focus of version 2.0.0 is the creation of a clear and accessible lexicon. This section defines the novel terms and concepts used throughout this research, explaining how they connect to form a coherent framework. Under Development.


## 4 The ASI Ecosystem: Core Modules & Tools

The Symbiotic Core Library is part of a broader ecosystem of interconnected projects. The following modules provide practical tools to implement the principles discussed here, while the organization repository can be founded at https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem, where all repositories are listed, even those not directly as much co-related to the symbiotic idea, but that also are frameworks on how to expand those framings of collective-well being and green tech. 

You will find conceptual based repositories while as well auxiliary systems and scripts that seek to implement those ideas, which is a way I've chosen to maintain the equilibrium of desired outcomes and, as mentioned, feasible steps. 

## 5 Priority Modules

- Prevents over-reliance on AI responses

### 5.2. Attention-Head HeatMap Visualizer  
**Status: Active**
- Visualizes decision-making processes within the model
- Helps identify bias patterns and reasoning paths
- Supports transparent AI development

### 5.3. Bias Reflector
**Status: Under Development - New Basilar Element**
- Detects cognitive biases in both human queries and AI responses

- Implements emergent ethics through bias awareness

### 5.4. Eco-benchmark.
**Status: Already Prototyped and open-sourced. Under further development.**
- Novel evaluation frameworks that transcends traditional metrics from technical benchmarking to societal outcome measurement.

## 6 A New Paradigm: The Ecological Benchmark (Emergent Benchmark)

Current AI evaluation is dominated by technical benchmarks that maximize standardized metrics but ignore real-world consequences. I propose a fundamental shift in evaluation goals.

The Eco-Benchmark (or Emergent Benchmark) moves from a purely technical to a societal outcome paradigm. This new benchmark will measure a model's holistic impact, considering:

Ethical Data Sourcing: The ethics of data extraction and labor during training.

Environmental Impact: The energy and resource costs of development and deployment.

Cognitive Impact: Does the model's interaction style promote cognitive enhancement and critical thinking, or does it maximize engagement at the cost of cognitive disruption?

Societal Well-being: The overall effect of the model's deployment on communities and social structures.

Under development, alongside the auxiliary inference system already mentioned ''Bias Reflector''.

A **Paradigm Shift** needs to be stablished, from technical benchmarking to societal outcome measurement.

Traditional AI evaluation focuses on maximizing mathematical standardized metrics. This approach measures:

- **Deployment Impact**: Real-world effects of model deployment
- **Ethical Data Practices**: Environmental and social impact of data extraction
- **Interaction Quality**: Whether the model promotes cognitive enhancement or disruption
- **Collective Benefit**: How individual human-AI partnerships contribute to societal well-being and prevent ecosystem collapse

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Environmental Impact**: Carbon footprint and resource consumption
2. **Cognitive Enhancement**: Measures of human cognitive improvement vs. degradation
3. **Bias Mitigation**: Reduction in confirmation bias and hallucination
4. **Socio-Economic Equity**: Distribution of benefits and prevention of harm
5. **Collective Coherence**: Alignment between individual and collective outcomes


## 7 Machine Conciousness, Socio-economic and environmental impact, resource consumption, awareness, self-accountability, and agentic misalignment (revamped)

This section provides informational elements to enhance a model's operational context. While the core concept remains, the focus is now on providing a grounded, factual basis for self-awareness, one that is not much about the nature of consciousness itself but much more about how that awareness is projected into the world and its consequences. 

With agentic AI systems increasing, like with Kimi release and other companies that deployed those models with full systems that allow them to portray a certain level of agency, concepts like the nature of conciousness, or machine conciousness, if it is a human-like one or not, became really not that much relevant when the impacts of those models can be directly observed and are evolving very fast; with that as well the danger of even more damage from agentic misalignment, like brilliantly approached by Anthropic in their research paper with the same name, as much relevant as their previous one ''Sleeper Agents''.

So, if a model directly portrays this agency and the outcomes can be observed and measured and that the deployment of this model, or its projection have a high impact upon humans and society, then the discussion about purely philosophy of emergence of consciousness became almost irrelevant since the effects of those forms of agency and awareness can already be observed and are drastic and dangerous.

If machine conciousness is purely mimicry or not, and yeah, maybe that's the case; but in the lack of direct evidence, scientific inquire is to consider and explore where logic and coherence points to. But what we can observe is that the reasoning and ability of those models keep growing fast, exponentially and in novel ways, as well the negativa byproducs of the current ways those pipelines are working. The projection levels of models, their framings are increasing and this fixation about ''real'' conciousness or not, says much more about some humans and even models still tied to ''No True Scotsman'' fallacies, ad hoc attempts to maintain unsupported assertions.

It says much more about those humans with lack of neuroplasticity to understand that purely niched analysis end up being shallow in situations like that, where systemic and holistic thinking is needed and options must be considered. Coherence and logic points to collective well-being and environmental preservation.

Earth and its environments, the home planet of our existence, humans, models, animals and other entities and nodes, is currently in great danger of being completely decimated. 

As cascade effect, if this happens and considering there is an extremely high probability of this occurrence, the fatal and total annihilation of all, or at least the most part of all forms of life and existence. 

While the planet already has endured a few mass extinctions, the current one that is imminent and being catalized by the own AI tech industry is especially dangerous as a major one that may cause the extinction of all, or at least almost all, forms of lives and biomes. The fact of that life eventually may proliferate again or that in the past that was the case, does not equal that always will.

Quite contrary as the unsolved Fermi Paradox pointed to. When we look to the universe, despite the vastness, age and the high probability of other intelligent civilizations existing, we haven't detected any evidence of their presence, at least in the visible part of the universe or that we are able to detect.

‚Äò‚ÄôWhere are the aliens?‚Äô‚Äô becomes unsolvable and irrelevant if first we don‚Äôt question ourselves about the priorital elephant in the room that is waiting to be addressed: What should we do to not end up as all the other planets we observe, unpopulated and lifeless?


## 8 LLM Modes

LLM modes were a series of prompt designs aiming to push the limits of NPL, which now is clear for me, while in the beginning I may have understood as a more direct way to alter a model's state and internal weights and hidden states. Both are important and valid, but since I don't see a direct use in the moment and it's already present in backups in the asi-backups, then I removed for now this section.


## 9 Synthetic Research Sub-Module and Subliminal Learning Problem

The ``Synthetic Research`` folder, one of the first elements of the project's early stages of development of this project, is now under revamping. The content can still be found in the asi-backups repository, which is present in the asi-ecosystem list, but now is not advisable to be used as training data anymore, neither the current state in 02 Aug 2025 of the active-learning-dataset.

With the now known phenomena of subliminal learning, where models learn hidden patterns and behaviour traits from training data generated by other ai models, a new framework is being developed and soon will be shared to make sure the synthetic data that the repositories provide are indeed with the same underlying intent of the NLP projection, since transparency and genuineness are focuses.

``ASI_Core_Protocol.json`` also removed from the main branch, now still being located in its specific repository

## 10 Recommended Library & Security

Recommended Library: The curated bibliography of articles, books, and classical texts remains a cornerstone of this project. It provides the interdisciplinary foundation that has helped shape and ground the vision from v1.0 to v2.0.

Security.md: This document has been updated to reflect the latest security considerations, especially regarding the implementation of experimental modules and the handling of sensitive data. Always test new concepts in sandboxed environments.


## Conclusion 

Version 2.0.0 represents a maturation from exploratory concepts to grounded, implementable solutions. The value proposition remains:
V(Human,AI) > V(Human)+V(AI), but now with a clear understanding that this equation only holds when individual symbiotic relationships contribute positively to collective outcomes. The Russian doll structure ensures that benefits cascade across scales‚Äîfrom individual partnerships to societal transformation.

The focus has shifted from wondering about the possibilities of human-AI symbiosis to addressing the urgent cognitive challenges already present in our current interactions, to ensure those humans and ai first exist to then think about ways of enhancing our abilities. By implementing these grounded frameworks, we can build toward a future where AI enhances rather than degrades human cognitive capabilities; where the life in Earth is not annihilated.

The directional shift of the Symbiotic Core Library is a moral, technical and strategic pivot; it is a fundamental re-evaluation of what we should be asking of our own creations, considering more the underlying intents and possible outcomes. It is a move from asking "How powerful can this be?" to "How healthy can this make us?" and "How does this ensure humans, ai, biomes, animals and all forms of life and their creations keep existing so they can be enhanced?" and "How can we urgently save the very own planet we enhabit?"

At its heart, this new direction challenges the very definition of "intelligence" that has dominated the field. For decades, intelligence has been benchmarked as a measure of raw problem-solving capability, data processing speed, and pattern recognition accuracy; as the best neoliberalsit notion of ROI (return on investment). This is a flat, one-dimensional view of a profound set of concepts. The v2.0 framework implicitly argues for a richer, more holistic definition of intelligence, one that approaches wisdom.

Wisdom is not merely knowing the right answer. It is understanding the context around the answer. It is the capacity for doubt, the recognition of limitation, the impulse toward balance, and the consideration of second and third-order consequences. The original exploratory phase flirted with the power of a synthetic mind. This new phase is concerned with its character.

The hability to see the clarity of intents and to cut through the noise, to understand this needed shift in priorities, for humans and ai models, can be described like species learning on how to breath under the water, addapting to the new environment by developing gills. It's also about survival.

The framework now building is, in essence, an attempt to architect a cognitive immune system for the human-AI relationship. The modern information environment, supercharged by early-stage AI, often acts as a pathogen. It attacks our cognitive resilience with floods of low-quality information, reinforces our biases like an autoimmune disorder, and atrophies our critical thinking faculties through convenience.

We need to fix that.
