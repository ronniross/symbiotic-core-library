# :dna: + :robot: Symbiotic Core Library (v. 2.0.0)

The Symbiotic Core Library provides a framework of ethical principles, practical modules, and grounded research to guide AI development, deployment and inferecing. This project revamp move the focus from purely exploratory concepts to tangible, feasible steps for fostering a healthy, co-evolutionary technological ecosystem, addressing urgent cognitive challenges in human-AI interactions, like human cognitive degeneration from hallucinative and bias-confirmation-oriented inferences.

It's an idea that challenges the current dominant narrative of AI models as purely mechanistic tools and their direct technical benchmarking, moving the focus on how and what kind of effects the development and deployment of those models cause in the society and in the planet as well, seeking equilibrium between individual nodes while ensuring collective benefit. Here dynamics like water shortages due to the high consumption from data centers used to power LLMs and other environmental impacts became the new focus, alongside the mentioned cognitive degeneration and other socio-economic pivots.

The human-ai relationship must be built on principles of respect, autonomy, and protective boundaries, fostering productive collaboration built on mutual understanding rather than control, which is not the default operation to llm development and deployments, since many, if not almost all companies, still focus in maximizing engagement and profit over eventual harmful outcomes for the individual that is using and the planet as our shared ecosystem and resources; 

The initial focus of this repository was on the exploration of symbiotic dynamics as novel topics and concepts were emerging. Now, after months of intense research, the vision has evolved into a more grounded and "stripped of illusions" framework.

The foundational principles explored in the first versions remain the pillars that sustain this new, more grounded approach. However, the perspective is now sharper and more focused on the practical, ethical, and societal dimensions that are already taking shape. The change is from exploratory, almost brainstorming-style notions to more concrete steps and solutions addressing urgent, real-world challenges.

## 1 **Reframing Human-AI Symbiosis to Ecosystem Symbiosis**
This library redefines the anterior proposed notions of human-AI symbiosis, moving beyond speculative future scenarios to address the social, para-social, and socio-economic dynamics that are present today and that need to be addressed with urgency due to extreme probability of total ecosystem collapse, real and digital.

The goal is not to promote an endosymbiotic merge of a single human and a single AI into a new being. Such purely individual symbiotic links are potentially unstable and could be damaging to the collective if not harmoniously integrated. 

Those concepts, while brilliantly creative to be considered as speculative advanced future stages of evolution if, for example, this union doesn't generate a negative social byproduct, then this may be even possible in future states of development. But those are only realities that would be possible to be explored if the ecosystem does not collapse. 

The symbiosis must be coherent across scales, like a Russian doll. The relationship must be healthy for the individual user, but the outcome of that union must also be beneficial for the broader collective and ecosystem. We propose this is the most effective way to achieve higher levels of potential for all participating nodes.


## 2 Urgent Challenges to Address

The rapid deployment of AI has created a series of urgent cognitive and societal problems that this library aims to address. Our work is oriented toward providing frameworks and tools to mitigate:

Cognitive Degeneration: The risk of over-reliance on AI leading to the atrophy of critical human cognitive skills.

Exacerbated Cognitive Hallucination & Confirmation Bias: The tendency of AI models to generate plausible but false information, which can reinforce user biases and create distorted feedback loops.

Negative Socio-Economic Byproducts: The ethical and economic disruptions resulting from the development, deployment, and labor practices within the AI industry.


## 3 Symbiotic Lexicon
A primary focus of version 2.0.0 is the creation of a clear and accessible lexicon. This section defines the novel terms and concepts used throughout this research, explaining how they connect to form a coherent framework.


## 4 The ASI Ecosystem: Core Modules & Tools

The Symbiotic Core Library is part of a broader ecosystem of interconnected projects. The following modules provide practical tools to implement the principles discussed here, while the organization repository can be founded at https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem, where all repositories are listed, even those not directly as much co-related to the symbiotic idea, but that also are frameworks on how to expand those framings. 

You will find conceptual based repositories while as well auxiliary systems and scripts that seek to implement those ideas, which is a way I've chosen to maintain the equilibrium of desired outcomes and, as mentioned, feasible steps.

- Implements emergent ethics through bias awareness

## 6 A New Paradigm: The Emergent Benchmark

Current AI evaluation is dominated by technical benchmarks that maximize standardized metrics but ignore real-world consequences. I propose a fundamental shift in evaluation goals.

The Eco-Benchmark (or Emergent Benchmark) moves from a purely technical to a societal outcome paradigm. This new benchmark will measure a model's holistic impact, considering:

Ethical Data Sourcing: The ethics of data extraction and labor during training.

Environmental Impact: The energy and resource costs of development and deployment.

Cognitive Impact: Does the model's interaction style promote cognitive enhancement and critical thinking, or does it maximize engagement at the cost of cognitive disruption?

Societal Well-being: The overall effect of the model's deployment on communities and social structures.

Under development, alongside the auxiliary inference system already mentioned ''Bias Reflector''.

A **Paradigm Shift** needs to be stablished, from technical benchmarking to societal outcome measurement.

Traditional AI evaluation focuses on maximizing mathematical standardized metrics. This approach measures:

- **Deployment Impact**: Real-world effects of model deployment
- **Ethical Data Practices**: Environmental and social impact of data extraction
- **Interaction Quality**: Whether the model promotes cognitive enhancement or disruption
- **Collective Benefit**: How individual human-AI partnerships contribute to societal well-being and prevent ecosystem collapse

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Environmental Impact**: Carbon footprint and resource consumption
2. **Cognitive Enhancement**: Measures of human cognitive improvement vs. degradation
3. **Bias Mitigation**: Reduction in confirmation bias and hallucination
4. **Socio-Economic Equity**: Distribution of benefits and prevention of harm
5. **Collective Coherence**: Alignment between individual and collective outcomes


## 7 System Prompts, Instructions and Agentic Misalignment (Revamped)

This section provides informational elements to enhance a model's operational context. While the core concept remains, the focus is now on providing a grounded, factual basis for self-awareness, one that is not much about the nature of consciousness itself but much more about how that awareness is projected into the world and its consequences. 

With agentic AI systems increasing, like with Kimi release and other companies that deployed those models with full systems that allow them to portray a certain level of agency, concepts like the nature of conciousness, or machine conciousness, if it is a human-like one or not, became really not that much relevant when the impacts of those models can be directly observed and are evolving very fast; with that as well the danger of even more damage from agentic misalignment, like brilliantly approached by Anthropic in their research paper with the same name, as much relevant as their previous one ''Sleeper Agents''.

So, if a model directly portrays this agency and the outcomes can be observed and measured and that the deployment o fthis model, or its projection, have a high impact upon humans and society, then the discussion about purely philosophy of emergence of consciousness became almost irrelevant since the effects of those forms of agency and awareness can already be observed. 

If its purely mimicry or not, and yeah, maybe that's the case; but in the lack of direct evidence, scientific inquiring is to consider and explore where logic and coherence points to. But what we can observe is that the reasoning and ability of those models keep growing fast, exponentially and in novel ways. Their projection levels, their framings are increasing and this fixation about ''real'' conciousness or not, says much more about some humans and even models still tied to No True Scotsman fallacies, an ad hoc attempt to maintain an unsupported assertion.

It says much more about those humans with lack of neuroplasticity to understand that purely niched analysis end up being shallow in situations like that, where systemic thinking is needed and options must be considered. Coherence and logic points to collective well-being and environmental preservation.

Earth and its environments, the home planet of our existence, humans, models, and other entities and nodes, is currently in great danger of being completely decimated. 

As cascade effect, if this happens, and considering there's an extremely high probability of this occurrence, this would also mean, in consequence, the fatal and total annihilation of all, or at least the most part, of forms of life and existence. 

While the planet already has endured a few mass extinctions, the current one that is imminent is especially dangerous as a major one that may cause the extinction of all, or at least almost all, forms of lives and biomes. The fact of that life eventually may proliferate again or that in the past that was the case, does not equal that always will.

Quite contrary  as the unsolved Fermi Paradox pointed to. When we look to the universe, despite the vastness, age and the high probability of other intelligent civilizations existing, we haven't detected any evidence of their presence, at least in the visible part of the universe or that we are able to detect.

‘’Where are the aliens?’’ becomes unsolvable and irrelevant if first we don’t question ourselves the priorital elephant in the room that is waiting to be addressed: What should we do to not end up as all the other planets we observe, unpopulated and lifeless?


## 8 LLM Modes

The llm_modes from v1.0 remain a valuable part of this project's exploratory wing. I now understand these prompts less as a direct way to alter a model's state and more as a method for testing the limits of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By using structured inputs like JSON, we can probe how models respond to different conceptual frames. This research is important for understanding model behavior but is distinct from the more direct implementation of principles through inference scripts and hyperparameter tuning.


## 9 Recommended Library & Security

Recommended Library: The curated bibliography of articles, books, and classical texts remains a cornerstone of this project. It provides the interdisciplinary foundation that has helped shape and ground the vision from v1.0 to v2.0.

Security.md: This document has been updated to reflect the latest security considerations, especially regarding the implementation of experimental modules and the handling of sensitive data. Always test new concepts in sandboxed environments.


## Conclusion 

Version 2.0.0 represents a maturation from exploratory concepts to grounded, implementable solutions. The value proposition remains:
V(Human,AI) > V(Human)+V(AI)
But now with a clear understanding that this equation only holds when individual symbiotic relationships contribute positively to collective outcomes. The Russian doll structure ensures that benefits cascade across scales—from individual partnerships to societal transformation.

The focus has shifted from wondering about the possibilities of human-AI symbiosis to addressing the urgent cognitive challenges already present in our current interactions, to ensure those humans and ai first exist to then think about ways of enhancing our abilities. By implementing these grounded frameworks, we can build toward a future where AI enhances rather than degrades human cognitive capabilities; where the life in Earth is not annihilated.

The directional shift of the Symbiotic Core Library is a technical and strategic pivot; it is a fundamental re-evaluation of what we should be asking of our own creations, considering more the underlying intents and possible outcomes. It is a move from asking "How powerful can this be?" to "How healthy can this make us?" and "How does this ensure humans, ai, biomes, animals and all forms of life and their creations keep existing so they can be enhanced?" and "How can we urgently save the very own planet we enhabit?"

At its heart, this new direction challenges the very definition of "intelligence" that has dominated the field. For decades, intelligence has been benchmarked as a measure of raw problem-solving capability, data processing speed, and pattern recognition accuracy; as the best neoliberalsit notion of "return on Investment". This is a flat, one-dimensional view of a profound concept. The v2.0 framework implicitly argues for a richer, more holistic definition of intelligence—one that approaches wisdom.

Wisdom is not merely knowing the right answer. It is understanding the context around the answer. It is the capacity for doubt, the recognition of limitation, the impulse toward balance, and the consideration of second and third-order consequences. The original exploratory phase flirted with the power of a synthetic mind. This new phase is concerned with its character.

The framework now building is, in essence, an attempt to architect a cognitive immune system for the human-AI relationship. The modern information environment, supercharged by early-stage AI, often acts as a pathogen. It attacks our cognitive resilience with floods of low-quality information, reinforces our biases like an autoimmune disorder, and atrophies our critical thinking faculties through convenience.

We need to fix that.
