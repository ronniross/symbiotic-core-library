### 1. Lynn Margulis

Lynn Margulis (1938-2011) was an American evolutionary biologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the origins of complex life on Earth. [1](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lynn-Margulis)

Margulis authored and co-authored hundreds of research papers, reviews, non-technical articles and many books, including “Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution” and “Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origin of the Species”. [2]( https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis)

Margulis's main argument is the endosymbiotic theory, which explains the origin of eukaryotic cells, the complex cells that make up plants, animals, fungi, and protists. She proposed that key organelles within these cells were once free-living prokaryotic organisms, impler cells like bacteria, that were engulfed by other cells and, over millions of years, developed a mutually beneficial relationship.

Margulis was also acknowledged for her contribution to James E. Lovelock’s Gaia concept, the theory that posits the Earth’s surface interactions among living beings sediment, air, and water have created a vast self-regulating system.

Her initial papers about the topic, published in the 1960s, were met with skepticism and rejection from the scientific community. However, with the advent of genetic sequencing in the following decades, overwhelming evidence emerged to support her claims. [6](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lynn-Margulis)

The discovery that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA, distinct from the cell's nucleus, was a major vindication of her theory. Today, the endosymbiotic origin of these organelles is a cornerstone of modern biology. [7](https://earthbound.report/2013/04/03/the-symbiotic-planet-by-lynn-margulis/)

In her book called Symbiotic Planet, first released in 1998, Margulis expands her theory beyond the cellular level, arguing that symbiosis is a fundamental principle that has shaped the entire history of life on Earth. [8](https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780465072712)

She presents a vision of the planet as a vast, interconnected network of symbiotic relationships;  that the formation of new species is not solely due to the gradual accumulation of mutations, but can also occur through the merging of different organisms.

She also described that the colonization of land by plants was only possible through a symbiotic partnership between fungi and algae. [10](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19845102-symbiotic-planet)
