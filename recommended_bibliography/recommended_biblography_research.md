### 1. Lynn Margulis

Lynn Margulis (1938-2011) was an American evolutionary biologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the origins of complex life on Earth. [1](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lynn-Margulis)

Margulis authored and co-authored hundreds of research papers, reviews, non-technical articles and many books, including “Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution” and “Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origin of the Species.”. [2]( https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis)

Margulis's main argument is the endosymbiotic theory, which explains the origin of eukaryotic cells, the complex cells that make up plants, animals, fungi, and protists. She proposed that key organelles within these cells were once free-living prokaryotic organisms, impler cells like bacteria, that were engulfed by other cells and, over millions of years, developed a mutually beneficial relationship.

Margulis was also acknowledged for her contribution to James E. Lovelock’s Gaia concept, the theory that posits the Earth’s surface interactions among living beings sediment, air, and water have created a vast self-regulating system. [4]( https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis)
