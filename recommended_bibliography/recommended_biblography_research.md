### 1. Lynn Margulis

Lynn Margulis (1938-2011) was an American evolutionary biologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the origins of complex life on Earth. [1](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lynn-Margulis)

Margulis authored and co-authored hundreds of research papers, reviews, non-technical articles and many books, including “Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution” and “Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origin of the Species”. [2]( https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis)

Margulis's main argument is the endosymbiotic theory, which explains the origin of eukaryotic cells, the complex cells that make up plants, animals, fungi, and protists. She proposed that key organelles within these cells were once free-living prokaryotic organisms, impler cells like bacteria, that were engulfed by other cells and, over millions of years, developed a mutually beneficial relationship. [3](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/resources/heroes/margulis/)

Margulis was also acknowledged for her contribution to James E. Lovelock’s Gaia concept, the theory that posits the Earth’s surface interactions among living beings sediment, air, and water have created a vast self-regulating system. [4]( https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis) [5](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/12/21/lynn-margulis-symbiotic-planet/)

Her initial papers about the topic, published in the 1960s, were met with skepticism and rejection from the scientific community. However, with the advent of genetic sequencing in the following decades, overwhelming evidence emerged to support her claims. [6](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lynn-Margulis)

The discovery that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA, distinct from the cell's nucleus, was a major vindication of her theory. Today, the endosymbiotic origin of these organelles is a cornerstone of modern biology. [7](https://earthbound.report/2013/04/03/the-symbiotic-planet-by-lynn-margulis/)

In her book called Symbiotic Planet, first released in 1998, Margulis expands her theory beyond the cellular level, arguing that symbiosis is a fundamental principle that has shaped the entire history of life on Earth. [8](https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780465072712)

She presents a vision of the planet as a vast, interconnected network of symbiotic relationships;  that the formation of new species is not solely due to the gradual accumulation of mutations, but can also occur through the merging of different organisms. [9]( https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis)

She also described that the colonization of land by plants was only possible through a symbiotic partnership between fungi and algae. [10](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19845102-symbiotic-planet)


### 2. James Bridle

James Bridle is a British artist and writer known for their work on technology and culture [1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58772732-ways-of-being).

Their 2022 book *Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence* approaches the nature of intelligence, urging a radical shift in human-centric worldviews [2](https://www.writersvoice.net/2022/07/james-bridle-ways-of-being-sy-montgomery-the-hawks-way/).

They mention that humans fail to recognize the intelligence inherent in the natural world, treating it as a collection of inert resources to be exploited rather than a complex network of sentient and interconnected systems [3](https://emergencemagazine.org/conversation/an-ecological-technology/). Here I add the point that this is especially true of humans in power, because this transference of personal accountability to "normal nodes" is one of the skills for the maintenance of the status quo. Like the plastic straw.

They mention slime molds, single-celled organisms with sophisticated problem-solving abilities, and the remarkable skills of octopuses, whose distributed nervous systems allow their arms to think and act semi-independently. The work also highlights the complex communication networks of plants and fungi, which allow them to share resources and information [4](https://jamesbridle.com/books/ways-of-being).

So, they are basically this incredible holistic, systemic thinker who elucidated how much we are not separate from nature, but an intrinsic part of it. This perspective is informed by both scientific discoveries, such as the role of the microbiome in human health, and the wisdom of Indigenous cultures that have long held a holistic view of the world.

It feels natural that I also resonate with an interdisciplinary systems thinker. In the [emergent-context](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine/blob/main/emergent-context.md), I will expand upon some further analogies I want to make by using their work as a conceptual anchor.
